# Jobber Sync Fix Summary

## Problem
The Jobber sync was returning a 500 error with the message "An API version must be specified".

## Root Cause
Jobber's GraphQL API requires the `X-JOBBER-GRAPHQL-VERSION` header to be included in all API requests.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Required Header
Added `X-JOBBER-GRAPHQL-VERSION: 2023-11-15` to all Jobber GraphQL API calls:
- jobberClients
- jobberJobs  
- jobberSync
- jobberTest
- jobberDebug

### 2. Enhanced Debugging
- Added deployment timestamp to logs: `v3 deployed at ${new Date().toISOString()}`
- Added request header logging to see exactly what's being sent
- Added `.trim()` to access tokens to prevent whitespace issues

### 3. Testing Tools Created
- `debug-jobber.html` - Full debugging interface
- `test-api-version.html` - Tests different API versions
- `test-jobber-endpoint.html` - Direct endpoint testing

## Deployment Steps

1. **Re-authenticate Firebase** (run in your terminal):
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

2. **Deploy the updated functions**:
   ```bash
   cd dashboard-v3/functions
   firebase deploy --only functions --force
   ```

3. **Test the fix**:
   - Go to https://duetright-dashboard.web.app/debug-jobber.html
   - Click "Debug Connection Details" first
   - Then click "Sync Jobber Data"

4. **Monitor logs**:
   ```bash
   firebase functions:log --only jobberSync
   ```
   Look for: "Fetching clients from Jobber API (v3 deployed at [timestamp])..."

## Expected Result
The sync should now work properly and import your Jobber clients and jobs into Firebase Firestore.
