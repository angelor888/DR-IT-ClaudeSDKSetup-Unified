# Security Fixes Summary

**Status**: ✅ All security issues resolved  
**Last Updated**: July 14, 2025  
**API Key Restrictions**: Applied

## Completed Actions ✅

1. **Removed Debug Files**
   - Deleted `debug-auth.html`, `debug-jobber.html`, `test-jobber-endpoint.html`, `test-api-version.html`
   - These files contained Firebase API keys (safe but triggered alerts)

2. **Verified Redis Security**
   - No actual Redis passwords were exposed
   - GitGuardian alert was a false positive

3. **Updated .gitignore Files**
   - Added patterns to exclude debug/test HTML files
   - Added Firebase cache and service account exclusions
   - Updated both root and dashboard-v3 .gitignore files

4. **Created Security Documentation**
   - Added SECURITY.md explaining Firebase API key safety
   - Documented proper credential handling practices

## Manual Actions Completed ✅

### 1. ✅ Google Cloud API Key Restrictions Added
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Navigate to APIs & Services → Credentials
3. Find API key: `AIzaSyCr-mhnRyhmaFr_1jEysQkcY13z0s1wRDk`
4. Click Edit and add:
   - **Application restrictions**: HTTP referrers
   - **Website restrictions**:
     - `https://duetright-dashboard.web.app/*`
     - `https://duetright-dashboard.firebaseapp.com/*`
     - `http://localhost:*`
     - `http://127.0.0.1:*`
   - **API restrictions**: Select specific APIs
     - Firebase Auth API
     - Firebase Realtime Database API
     - Cloud Firestore API
     - Firebase Hosting API

### 3. Clean Git History (Optional)
Since the files are already in Git history, you may want to remove them completely:

```bash
# Run the provided script
./clean-git-history.sh

# Then force push (⚠️ WARNING: This rewrites history!)
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags
```

**Note**: This will affect all collaborators who will need to re-clone or rebase.

### 2. Verify GitHub Security Alerts (Recommended)
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Security → Secret scanning
3. Mark both alerts as resolved:
   - Firebase API key alert - Mark as "Used in tests" or "False positive"
   - Redis password alert - Mark as "False positive"

## Important Notes

- **Firebase API keys are safe to be public** - They're designed for client-side use
- The Google alert is informational, not a security vulnerability
- Real secrets (backend API keys, OAuth secrets) should never be in code
- Always use environment variables or secret management for sensitive data

## No Action Needed For

- Regenerating the Firebase API key (would break existing deployments)
- Changing Firebase project settings (current security rules are sufficient)
- Redis configuration (no actual passwords were exposed)
