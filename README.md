# 🚀 Claude SDK Setup - Unified Environment

> **One Environment. Two Machines. Zero Confusion.**

This is the **unified Claude development environment** that consolidates all the best practices from multiple setups into one streamlined, machine-aware system.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Morning Routine (5 seconds to productivity)
```bash
~/claude-start
```

That's it! This single command:
- ✅ Detects your machine (Megan or Morgan)
- ✅ Syncs latest changes from GitHub
- ✅ Loads machine-specific optimizations
- ✅ Starts required services
- ✅ Shows personalized dashboard
- ✅ Opens your last project

## 🏗️ What's Included

### Best Practices Integrated
1. **Alex Finn's 8-Step Workflow** - Plan mode, security checks, learning loops
2. **27 MCP Servers** - Complete automation suite
3. **SDK Examples** - Python & TypeScript ready-to-use code
4. **Machine Intelligence** - Knows if you're on Megan (laptop) or Morgan (Mac mini)

### Key Features
- 🔄 **Automatic GitHub Sync** - Always up to date
- 💬 **Cross-Machine Messaging** - Leave notes between computers
- 🔋 **Battery-Aware** (Megan) - Reduces services on battery
- ⚡ **Performance Mode** (Morgan) - Full power when plugged in
- 📝 **Unified Claude.md** - One context to rule them all

## 🖥️ Machine-Specific Features

### Megan (Laptop)
- Battery optimization mode
- Reduced MCP server count on battery
- Lightweight sync intervals
- Mobile-friendly shortcuts

### Morgan (Mac Mini)
- Full performance mode
- All 27 MCP servers active
- Real-time sync enabled
- Development-focused layout

## 🛠️ Installation

### First Time Setup
```bash
cd ~/Projects
git clone [your-repo]/DR-IT-ClaudeSDKSetup-Unified.git
cd DR-IT-ClaudeSDKSetup-Unified
./scripts/first-time-setup.sh
```

### Daily Use
Just run `~/claude-start` every morning!

## 🔄 What Happened to Old Projects?

All previous Claude setups have been consolidated here:
- `claude-code-project` → Merged into `best-practices/alex-finn-workflow/`
- `DR-IT-ClaudeSDKSetup` → Core integrated throughout
- `easy-mcp` → Merged into `best-practices/mcp-services/`

Old projects are archived in `~/Claude-Archives/` with timestamps.

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Leave notes between machines**: `megan-note "Fixed the API bug!"`
2. **Check machine status**: `claude-status`
3. **Force specific mode**: `claude-start --performance`
4. **Quick project switch**: `claude-project myapp`

## 🎉 Benefits

- **One command startup** - No more confusion
- **Machine awareness** - Optimized for each computer
- **Best of all worlds** - Every good practice integrated
- **Clean workspace** - No duplicate projects
- **Future proof** - Easy to add new machines
