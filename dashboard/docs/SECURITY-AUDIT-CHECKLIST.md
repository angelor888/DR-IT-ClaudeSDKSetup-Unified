npx snyk monitor

# OWASP dependency check
dependency-check --project "DuetRight Dashboard" --scan .
```

### SSL/TLS Testing
```bash
# Test SSL configuration
nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 dashboard.duetright.com

# SSL Labs test (online)
# https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=dashboard.duetright.com

# Test with OpenSSL
openssl s_client -connect dashboard.duetright.com:443 -tls1_2
```

### Security Headers Testing
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I https://dashboard.duetright.com

# Online test
# https://securityheaders.com/?q=dashboard.duetright.com
```

### Port Scanning
```bash
# Check open ports
nmap -p- dashboard.duetright.com

# Check specific ports
nmap -p 22,80,443,5001 dashboard.duetright.com
```

### Application Security Testing
```bash
# OWASP ZAP scan
docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable zap-baseline.py \
  -t https://dashboard.duetright.com

# Nikto web scanner
nikto -h https://dashboard.duetright.com
```
