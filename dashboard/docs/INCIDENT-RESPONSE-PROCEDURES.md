# Incident Response Procedures

## Overview

This document outlines the procedures for responding to incidents affecting the DuetRight IT Dashboard. Follow these procedures to minimize impact, restore service quickly, and prevent recurrence.

## Incident Classification

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **P1 - Critical** | Complete service outage or data loss | 15 minutes | System down, data breach, critical security vulnerability |
| **P2 - High** | Major functionality impaired | 1 hour | Authentication failure, API errors >50%, database issues |
| **P3 - Medium** | Minor functionality impaired | 4 hours | Slow performance, individual feature failure |
| **P4 - Low** | Minimal impact | 24 hours | UI issues, non-critical bugs |

## Response Team

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Primary Contact | Backup Contact | Responsibilities |
|------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| Incident Commander | John Doe (+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX) | Jane Smith | Overall incident coordination |
| Technical Lead | Tech Lead | Senior Dev | Technical investigation and resolution |
| Communications Lead | PR Manager | Marketing | Stakeholder communication |
| Security Lead | Security Officer | CISO | Security-related incidents |

### Escalation Matrix

```
P1 Incidents: Immediate notification to all roles
P2 Incidents: Technical Lead + Incident Commander
P3 Incidents: Technical Lead + On-call Engineer
P4 Incidents: On-call Engineer
```

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Detection & Alert

**Automated Detection:**
- Monitoring alerts (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Health check failures
- Error rate thresholds exceeded
- Customer reports via support channels

**Initial Actions:**
```bash
# Verify the incident
curl -I https://dashboard.duetright.com/api/health

# Check monitoring dashboard
open https://grafana.duetright.com

# Review recent deployments
git log --oneline -10
kubectl rollout history deployment/duetright-dashboard
```

### 2. Triage & Classification

**Assessment Checklist:**
- [ ] Number of users affected
- [ ] Business functions impacted
- [ ] Data integrity concerns
- [ ] Security implications
- [ ] Customer-facing impact

**Classification Decision Tree:**
```
Is the service completely down? â†’ P1
Is authentication broken? â†’ P1
Are >50% of API calls failing? â†’ P2
Is a critical feature broken? â†’ P2
Is performance degraded >50%? â†’ P3
Other issues â†’ P4
```

### 3. Response & Mitigation

#### P1 Critical Response Playbook

**Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes):**

1. **Create Incident Channel**
```bash
# Slack command
/incident create "Dashboard Outage - P1"
```

2. **Implement Quick Fix**
```bash
# Rollback if recent deployment
kubectl rollout undo deployment/duetright-dashboard

# Or restart services
docker-compose restart dashboard

# Or failover to backup
./scripts/failover-to-backup.sh
```

3. **Notify Stakeholders**
```
Template: "We are aware of an issue affecting the DuetRight Dashboard. 
Our team is investigating and working to restore service. 
Updates will be provided every 15 minutes."
```

**Investigation (15-30 minutes):**

```bash
# Check logs
kubectl logs deployment/duetright-dashboard --tail=1000 | grep ERROR

# Check system resources
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods

# Database health
redis-cli ping
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health/services

# Recent changes
git diff HEAD~1
```

#### P2 High Response Playbook

**Actions (0-60 minutes):**

1. **Isolate the Problem**
```bash
# Check specific service health
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health/services/auth
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health/services/database

# Review error patterns
grep -E "ERROR|CRITICAL" /var/log/dashboard/app.log | tail -100
```

2. **Temporary Mitigation**
```bash
# Increase resources if needed
kubectl scale deployment/duetright-dashboard --replicas=5

# Clear cache if corruption suspected
redis-cli FLUSHDB

# Enable maintenance mode
kubectl set env deployment/duetright-dashboard MAINTENANCE_MODE=true
```

### 4. Resolution

**Fix Implementation:**
```bash
# Apply hotfix
git checkout -b hotfix/incident-XXX
# Make necessary changes
git commit -m "Hotfix: Resolve P1 incident XXX"
git push origin hotfix/incident-XXX

# Deploy fix
kubectl set image deployment/duetright-dashboard \
  dashboard=duetright/dashboard:hotfix-XXX

# Verify fix
./scripts/smoke-test.sh
```

**Verification Steps:**
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Error rates back to normal
- [ ] Performance metrics acceptable
- [ ] Affected features working
- [ ] No new errors introduced

### 5. Recovery

**Service Restoration:**
```bash
# Remove maintenance mode
kubectl set env deployment/duetright-dashboard MAINTENANCE_MODE-

# Scale back to normal
kubectl scale deployment/duetright-dashboard --replicas=3

# Clear any temporary flags
redis-cli DEL incident:flags:*
```

**Data Recovery (if needed):**
```bash
# Restore from backup
./scripts/restore.sh --timestamp "2025-07-13 10:00:00"

# Verify data integrity
node scripts/data-integrity-check.js

# Resync external services
node scripts/resync-external-services.js
```

### 6. Post-Incident

# Preserve evidence
sudo tar -czf /evidence/incident-$(date +%s).tar.gz \
  /var/log /opt/duetright-dashboard/logs

# Rotate all credentials
./scripts/rotate-credentials.sh --all

# Enable enhanced logging
kubectl set env deployment/duetright-dashboard \
  LOG_LEVEL=debug SECURITY_AUDIT=true
```

### Data Loss Incidents

**Recovery Steps:**
```bash
# Stop writes to prevent further loss
kubectl set env deployment/duetright-dashboard READ_ONLY_MODE=true

# Identify extent of loss
node scripts/data-audit.js --from "2 hours ago"

# Restore from closest backup
./scripts/restore.sh --partial --tables affected_tables

# Replay transaction logs
node scripts/replay-transactions.js --from "backup_timestamp"
```

### Performance Degradation

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# CPU profiling
kubectl exec -it dashboard-pod -- \
  node --cpu-prof --cpu-prof-duration=30

# Memory analysis
kubectl exec -it dashboard-pod -- \
  node --heapsnapshot-signal=SIGUSR2

# Query analysis
redis-cli SLOWLOG GET 10

# Network diagnosis
tcpdump -i any -w network-trace.pcap
```
