# âœ… Morgan Setup Complete!

## Status: Fully Operational

Morgan (Mac Mini) is now running the unified Claude environment and ready for cross-machine synchronization with Megan!

## What's Working

### âœ… Machine Identity
- Morgan identified as "Mac mini" 
- Performance mode active (all services)
- Machine ID saved for future startups

### âœ… Configuration
- 54 API tokens preserved from previous setup
- All Claude scripts and templates available
- Shell integration loaded

### âœ… Cross-Machine Messaging
- Successfully sent message to Megan
- Message will appear on Megan's next startup
- Command: `megan-note "your message"`

### âœ… Daily Workflow Ready
- Morning: `~/claude-start` or `claude-start`
- Leave notes: `megan-note "message"`
- All Claude commands available

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check machine identity
cat ~/.claude-machine-id
# Output: morgan

# Send message to Megan
megan-note "Testing from Morgan!"

# Start your day
claude-start

# Initialize a project
claude-init

# Enter plan mode
claude-plan
```

## Next Time on Megan

When you return to Megan (laptop), you'll see:
1. Morgan's message in the morning startup
2. Any commits Morgan pushed to GitHub
3. Perfect synchronization between both machines

## Notes

- MCP services still need to be installed if you want to use them
- The setup preserved all your existing API tokens
- Both machines now share the same unified codebase
