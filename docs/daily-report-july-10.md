# Daily Report - July 10, 2025
## Unified Dashboard Development & Slack Configuration

### Summary
Today focused on two major initiatives: planning the unified dashboard architecture integrating Jobber, Slack, Google services, and QuickBooks, and resolving critical Slack bot configuration conflicts between Sky AI and Ai Assistant apps.

### 1. Dashboard Development Planning

#### Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure
- Designed comprehensive backend architecture with microservices pattern
- Created service integration layer for:
  - **Jobber**: Client management, invoicing, scheduling
  - **QuickBooks**: Financial data, transactions, reports
  - **Google Services**: Calendar, Gmail, Drive integration
  - **Slack**: Team notifications and bot interactions
- Defined RESTful API endpoints with JWT authentication
- Planned Redis caching and WebSocket real-time updates

#### Phase 2: Frontend & Agentic Features
- Vue.js dashboard with responsive design
- Real-time data visualization with Chart.js
- Agentic capabilities for:
  - Automated invoice matching
  - Smart scheduling optimization
  - Proactive alert system
  - Natural language task execution

#### Technical Review Feedback
Received comprehensive architecture review recommending:
- Simplify from microservices to modular monolith
- Use Firestore instead of PostgreSQL
- Leverage Google Cloud services (Cloud Run, Cloud Tasks)
- Focus on Firebase ecosystem for faster development

### 2. Slack Configuration Resolution

#### Issue Identified
Two Slack apps were causing conflicts:
- **Sky AI**: Terminal/CLI operations (Claude integration)
- **Ai Assistant**: Zapier/Jobber webhook integration

#### Resolution Steps
1. Separated app configurations and use cases
2. Updated environment variables to use Sky AI for terminal
3. Fixed bot name display issue (was showing "Claude Code")
4. Successfully reinstalled Sky AI app with new token
5. Added Sky AI to all 22 active public channels

#### Current Status
- Sky AI: ✅ Working (bot token configured)
- Bot successfully added to all public channels
- Private channels require manual invitation or scope updates
- Auto-responder configuration updated

### 3. Service Testing Results

| Service | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| GitHub | ✅ Working | Full API access |
| Slack | ✅ Fixed | Sky AI configured |
| Airtable | ✅ Working | Tables accessible |
| SendGrid | ✅ Working | Email API ready |
| Google Calendar | ✅ Working | Events readable |
| Jobber | ❌ Failed | Token expired, needs re-auth |
| QuickBooks | ❌ Failed | Invalid refresh token |
| Twilio | ⚠️ Untested | Credentials not found |

### 4. Key Files Created/Modified

#### Scripts
- `/scripts/add-sky-ai-to-all-channels.js` - Automated channel addition
- `/scripts/test-all-services.sh` - Comprehensive service testing
- `/scripts/debug-private-channels.js` - Private channel diagnostics
- `/scripts/find-my-private-channels.js` - Manual guidance script

#### Documentation
- `/docs/slack-apps-configuration.md` - App usage guidelines
- `/docs/add-private-channel-scopes.md` - OAuth scope instructions
- `/phase1-backend-architecture.md` - Detailed architecture plan

#### Configuration
- `~/.config/claude/environment` - Updated with Sky AI tokens
- Slack bot configuration aligned with Sky AI

### 5. Lessons Learned

1. **Slack App Management**: Clear separation between automation tools prevents conflicts
2. **Bot Permissions**: Private channels require explicit scopes (groups:read, groups:write)
3. **Architecture Planning**: Starting simple (monolith) often better than complex (microservices)
4. **Cloud Native**: Leveraging platform services (Firestore, Cloud Run) accelerates development
5. **Token Management**: Regular token rotation and validation prevents service disruptions

### 6. Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Re-authenticate Jobber through OAuth flow
   - Update QuickBooks refresh token
   - Add groups:read/write scopes to Sky AI

2. **Short Term**:
   - Implement simplified monolith architecture
   - Set up Firestore database
   - Create initial API endpoints

3. **Medium Term**:
   - Build Vue.js dashboard frontend
   - Implement real-time WebSocket updates
   - Add agentic automation features

### 7. Blockers

1. Jobber and QuickBooks tokens expired - need re-authentication
2. Private Slack channels require manual invitation or scope updates
3. Twilio credentials missing from environment

### Technical Debt

- Need to consolidate service credential management
- Consider using Google Secret Manager for sensitive data
- Implement automated token refresh mechanisms
